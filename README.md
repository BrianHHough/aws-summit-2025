# DEV301: From Vibe Coding to Production: Building Real AI Apps That Scale

Vibe Coding with GenAI is fast and fun — until your app has to actually work in production. That’s when reality hits: fragile APIs, missing auth, surprise AWS bills, strict constraints, and no clear path to scale. In this Dev Chat, I’ll share what it takes to evolve from AI-generated MVPs to real-world, production-ready apps for millions of users. We’ll talk infrastructure as code, scaling APIs, adding observability, and building systems that don’t break under pressure. If you’ve used GenAI tools like Amazon Q, Bedrock, or your favorite code copilot, this session will help you ship faster and smarter.
